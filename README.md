# 5Objects
A small OpenGL program that draws 5 different objects and allows you to stop/start moving them, at low/fast speed

Here is how to use the program (and translation, since the interface is written in Romanian, it was an old college homework):

1. To run the .exe (unless you compile the program yourself) you need to have the glut32.dll in the folder with the executable. I provided the newest version.

2.You will see a window with white background and 5 objects.

3. Right-click anywhere inside the window and you will get a menu with the five objects:
Cub (cube)
Con (cone)
Crate (the green football-like object, reminds me of the creates in tiberian sun )
Farfurie (saucer)
Glob pamantesc (earth globe, the sphere)

for each of the objects you have the following options:
Lent = slow
Rapid = fast
Reset = resets to starting position
